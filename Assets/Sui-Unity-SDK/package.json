This means that games built with our SDK can directly craft custom Move calls without relying Sui's 'unsafe' RPC calls under the Transaction Builder API -- which in turn reduces the number of RPC / Network requests.Our SDK fully supports mobile, desktop and WebGL application built with the Unity game engine.",
